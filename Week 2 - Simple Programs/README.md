### Simple Algorithms ###
1. The internal computer representation of any number is always an approximation. False
2. The decimal 11 is what binary? 1011
3. The internal representation of the decimal number 1/10 = 0.1 requires an infinite number of digits. True
4. After many computations, you get two floating numbers stored in variables a and b. Your code compares the numbers with a == b
	Doing the comparison will sometimes lead to a correct program.
