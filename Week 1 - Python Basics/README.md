### Introduction to python ###
1. An algorithm is a conceptual idea, a program is a concrete instantiation of an algorithm.
2. A computational mode of thinking means that everything can be viewed as a math problem involving numbers and formulas. True
3. Computer Science is the study of how to build efficient machines that run programs. False
4. The two things every computer can do are:
	- Perform calculations
	- Remember the results
5. Declarative knowledge refers to statements of fact. True
6. Imperative knowledge refers to 'how to' methods. True
7. A recipe for deducing the square root involves guessing a starting value for y. Without another recipe to be told how to pick a starting number, the computer cannot generate one on its own. True
8. A stored program computer is designed to compute precisely one computation, such as a square root, or the trajectory of a missile. False
9. A fixed program computer is designed to run any computation, by interpreting a sequence of program instructions that are read into it. False
10. A program counter points the computer to the next instruction to execute in the program.
11. What does it mean when we say that "the computer walks through the sequence executing some computation"? 
	The computer executes the instructions mostly in a linear sequence, except sometimes it jumps to a different place in the sequence.
12. In order to compute everything that is computable, every computer must be able to handle the sixteen most primitive operations. False
13.	- Syntax => Determines whether a string is legal
	- Static semantics => Determines whether a string has meaning
	- Semantics => Assigns a meaning to a legal sentence
